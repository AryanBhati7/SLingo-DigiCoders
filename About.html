        <h1>What is Sign Language?</h1>
        <p>Sign language is a captivating and expressive form of communication that relies on visual gestures, facial
            expressions, and body movements to convey meaning. It is a dynamic and complete language with its own
            intricate vocabulary, grammar, and syntax, allowing individuals who are Deaf or have hearing impairments to
            engage in meaningful conversations. Unlike spoken languages, sign language transcends auditory barriers,
            creating a vibrant and inclusive mode of communication that fosters connection and understanding. As a
            cultural and linguistic treasure, sign language not only enables Deaf communities to share thoughts and
            emotions but also serves as a testament to the richness and diversity of human expression.</p>
        <p>It is a complete language with a unique vocabulary, construction and grammar. In the United States, Sign
            Language is considered a foreign language due to its unique vocabulary and construction.</p>

        <h1>About ASL</h1>
        <p>American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as
            spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and
            face.</p>
        <p>It is the primary language of many North Americans who are deaf and is one of several communication options
            used by people who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language
            used primarily by the Deaf and hard-of-hearing community in the United States and parts of Canada. It is a
            visual and gestural language that employs hand movements, facial expressions, and body postures to convey
            meaning. ASL is recognized as a distinct and separate language with its own grammar and syntax, making it
            fundamentally different from spoken English.
            Key features of ASL include its use of handshapes, movements, and facial expressions to form words and
            sentences. Handshapes are a crucial component, and each handshape represents a specific phonological aspect
            of the language. Additionally, the movement of the hands, combined with facial expressions, conveys nuanced
            meanings, emotions, and grammatical structures.</p>
